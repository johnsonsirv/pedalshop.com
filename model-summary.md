## Model Associations

#### User
The *User* model has has_many *:orders* and has_many *:customizations*, which I used for tracking user activity.

#### Order and OrderItem
The *Order* model belongs to User and has many *OrderItems*. The OrderItem model, in turn, belongs to Order and Customization, establishing the relationship between the order and the specific customization a user has made.


#### Category and Product
The *Category* model has many *Products*, and *Product* belongs to *Category*.
The Product modelâ€™s relationship with *Part* through *ProductPart* gives me a flexible association between products and their parts.


#### Part and PartOption
The *Part* model belongs to *Product* and has many *PartOptions* through *ProductPartOptions*. This setup allows me to associate parts with specific products and their respective options, which is appropriate for business use case.


#### ProductPart and ProductPartOption
These models many-to-many relationships between Product and Part, and between Part and PartOption. I believe it is essential for the flexible configuration of product parts and options.


#### Customization
The *Customization* model belongs to both *User* and *Product*, with has_many *:order_items*. This structure will be used for tracking customizations and linking them to orders.


#### PartOptionCombination and PartOptionProhibition
These models are present but currently without associations. For now, they serve as standalone models for storing JSONB fields related to combinations and prohibitions.
